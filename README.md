# PastProjects
Projects from university and personal interests

Personal Project 1 - Rubix Slider Game
  - This was code created back in 2016 when I was still in my twelfth grade
  - This code was created around the time I decided I wanted to pursue software engineering in University
  - One of the only games I luckily saved on a separate USB before I did a full reset on my computer
  
Personal Project 2 - Guild Management
  - There is nothing in it as of now because its not worth showing yet
  - Its the most ambitious game I thought of creating recently and will not be finished anytime soon
  - I wanted to try my hand after learning more about OO programming and designing systems just to see how much I have progressed
  - A large hobbie project that I will slowly work on in my past time

Project 1
  - This was a project from my Data Structures class where we created a car renting system with linkd lists and a postorder calculator
  - Got a mark above 90/100
  
Project 2
  - This is the combination of assignment 1 and 2 from my Object Oriented Programming class
  - This was technically one large assignment broke up into two assignments
  - Assignment 1: we implemented the functionality of a university course and degree system
  - Assignment 2: we added UI with Java Swing andd added SQL database functionality
  - Got a mark of 100/100
  
Project 3
  - This was a project from my Data Structures class where we created a program that takes an equation with round braces and creates a binary tree from that string and another program that sorts a text files strings with heap sort
  - Got a mark above 90/100
  
Project 4
  - This was a project from my Data Structures class where we created a program that takes keys from a text file and sorts them into an AVL tree
  - Got a mark above 90/100

Project 5
  - This was a project from my Software Design II class where we were tasked to parse and create visual representations of census data from Statistics Canada using R and perl
  - In this folder is the code I created for the project
    - ProcessFileByField.pl: This parses a csv file based on user inputs (uses regex)
    - PlotEmployment.pl: Plots employment values based on education using R
    - PercentageContribution.pl: Creates a table based on user input about the amount a province contributes to a speciic education level (highschool, postsecondary, etc) in percentage 
    - CompareEducationEmploy.pl: Creates 3 CSV files for male, female, and both sexes and places values of employment based on education so that later PlotEmployment.pl can create a graph using R
  - Got a mark above 80/100
